Collective cell migrations are pivotal in biological processes as varied as wound healing and tumour invasion. This project studies a two-dimensional, cell-based model in freely-expanding epithelia. In the individual based model, cells interact with their neighbouring cells causing complex collective migration behavior. The model based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) exhibits a complex rich asymptotic behavior in terms of patterns, such as swarming and vortexes, that can be modelled numerically.
