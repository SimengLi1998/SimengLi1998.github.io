👋 Hi there! I’m Simeng Li, a data scientist with an engineering background and a master’s degree in business analytics from Boston University, where I completed my capstone project under the guidance of Professor Shawn Jin. During my studies, I gained practical experience in business analytics and led a cross-company collaboration as the PMO, guiding our team from data insights to implementation.

🚀 Currently, I’m a data mining engineer at a mobile gaming company, focused on increasing product visibility on Google Play. My work spans ASO (App Store Optimization), user acquisition strategies, machine learning model development, and recommendation system optimization, with guidance and collaboration from Professor Hao Fan at Wuhan University. To enhance workflow efficiency, I’ve developed tools like automated comment reply generation and sentiment analysis.

📈 My academic interests lie in recommendation systems and AI applications, especially in integrating large language models (LLMs) with traditional recommendation systems for more personalized experiences. I’m considering a PhD to further pursue these interests.

☕ Outside of work, I’m a coffee enthusiast and proud owner of a Chihuahua named “Coffee.” Looking forward to connecting over shared interests in data and tech!
