Hi! I’m Kate Wenqi Zhu. I am currently doing a Ph.D. in Applied [Mathematics](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysis) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) under the supervision of Prof [Coralia Cartis](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/coralia.cartis) fully funded by [CIMDA-Oxford studentship](https://cimda-oxford.datasig.ac.uk/team).

I previously obtained an M.Sc. degree in Mathematical Modelling and scientific computing from Oxford, under the supervision of Yuji Nakatsukasa. I also completed my first master’s and undergraduate degrees in Mathematics at Oxford. After completing my undergraduate degree, I took an academic career break to gain practical industry experience at Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan before pursuing my Ph.D.

**Research Interests**
======
My general interests lie in understanding how to utilize higher-order information for efficient nonconvex optimization, including but not limited to computational complexity analysis, tensor approximation, implementable high-order subproblem solver, the tractability of polynomial optimization, and adaptive regularization techniques. 

**Potential Collaborations:** If you are interested in these topics, feel free to reach out for more information!
